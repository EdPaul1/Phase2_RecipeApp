The app makes use of an online public server to fetch recipe data and display it to the user. The user can search for recipes using either an ingredient or a meal name, and the search results are displayed in a user-friendly format. Clicking on a recipe displays more detailed information about the recipe, including ingredients and instructions.

The application is fully functional and ready for use. However, further improvements and features could be added in the future, such as user accounts, recipe saving and sharing, and social media integration.
